Co-editor of the review book Discovery of the Higgs Boson, documenting the studies done at high energy colliders 
(LEP, Tevatron and LHC) for the search of the Higgs boson. Published by World Scientific in 2016 (ISBN: 978-981-4425-44-5).

* Awards
2009: "CMS Achievement Award", for outstanding contribution in the CMS ECAL commissioning 
(ECAL high voltage system -hardware- and data quality monitoring -software-).

* Research activity
My research activity focused on the experimental high energy physics.

From 2002 to 2007 it focused on the study of CP violation in the B
meson weak decays and the search of indirect signs of physics beyond
the Standard Model in the flavor sector through charmless b->s
decays. Measurement of the time-dependent CP violation of the B meson
in three kaon decays, first in the quasi-two-body approximation, then
including interference effects through the Dalitz plot.  A new
spin-zero resonance decaying in two charged kaons with mass around
1.55 GeV, the X_0(1550), have been found as contributing to the Dalitz
plot. Usage of ad hoc B production vertex measurement, based on K0S
vertex and e+e- interaction point constraint. These measurements
highly constrained the presence of non Standard Model processes with
large flavor violation.  I have been a collaborator of BaBar
experiment, running at the PEP-II e+e- collider in the SLAC laboratory
(Stanford, California), from 2002 to 2009.

From 2005 to 2006 operations manager and performance studies for the
muon and neutral hadron identification system of BaBar based on RPC
technology (IFR). Innovative algorithms for reconstructing and
identifying K0L particles through the combined use of electro-magnetic
calorimeter (EMC) and IFR. Demonstration of the aging effects of
fluoridric acid (HF) production in the gas mixture and possible
mitigations of it. This detector has shown a stable high efficiency
through the entire data-taking period, also with the change of the
operating mode from streamer to avalanche. Upgrade of the barrel
section of the IFR with Limited Streamer Tubes (LST).

In 2005 and 2006 responsible for the B flavour tagging efficiencies
and vertexing resolution, with the measurements used by all the BaBar
collaboration.  In 2005, tracking studies for the recovery of the loss
of efficiency in K0S reconstruction after the shutdown, allowing a
complete recovery at the start of the new run period of BaBar.

In 2007 I joined CMS collaboration and was involved on several
experimental activity regarding CMS commissioning: from 2007 to 2010
the high voltage system for the avalanche photo-diodes and development
of data quality monitoring of the electro-magnetic calorimeter
(ECAL). On the software side, developer of the online and offline ECAL
Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) system, which is still in use.

From 2011 to 2014 responsible of the monitoring of PbWO4 crystals
through a laser system, that is used to correct the continuous
transparency variations due to radiation during the LHC fills.

With the very early LHC data (36/pb at sqrt{s}=7 TeV), principal
author of the first measurement of the cross section for W and Z
production in association to up 4 jets.  With the same data,
measurement of the W charge asymmetry, useful as constraints for the
PDFs.  Contribution to the first measurement of inclusive W and Z
production with the early data, with the electron channels.

From 2008 developer of electron reconstruction and identification with
the CMS early data. From 2013 to 2014 coordinator of the electrons and
photons reconstruction sub-group of the EGamma physics group.

Since 2007 involved in the direct search of the Higgs boson of the
Standard Model (SM).  From 2011 to 2012 in CMS experiment analysis and
convenorship of the physics group for the search of the Higgs boson
with W pairs, that gave the first indication of the 125 GeV particle,
and finally contributed to its discovery. Presented personally at the
ICHEP 2012 conference in Melbourne. Proposed an analysis method to
allow the mass measurement in the presence of two neutrinos up to 3%
precision.  Measurements of the SM pp->W+W- production cross section
at sqrt{s}=7 and 8 TeV.

From 2012 to 2014 one of the principal authors of the Higgs search
with ZZ->4l final state (on electrons optimization for the search and
then on the properties measurement: mass and spin-CP. Coordinator of
the analysis group and the editor of the paper on Run I data from 2013
to 2014. Developer of an analysis technique for unfolding effective
Higgs couplings from data through an 8D fit, in collaboration with
theorists.

From 2014 to 2017 convener of the CMS ECAL Detector Performace Group
(DPG) as a group convener, responsible for the optimizations of its
running conditions, energy reconstruction algorithms, calibrations. In
this period I covered the transition from Run I to Run II, when LHC
changed the bunch spacing from 50 to 25 ns.  In 2014, main developer
of the of the completely new local energy reconstruction algorithm for
ECAL. This allowed ECAL to maintain the optimal energy resolution in
conditions of high pileup. The algorithm is still in use and
performing well up to the unprecedented peak pileup of 60 events per
bunch crossing. It is the standard algoithm foreseen for the HL LHC
phase in the ECAL barrel.

From 2015 to 2017 participated to the search of dark matter with MET
plus jets in the final state with 2016 CMS data (monojet and invisible
Higgs production), also with the supervision of a master degree
student (Rome La Sapienza).

From 2017, author of the preparatory measurements needed for the W
mass measurement (W helicity, rapidity, charge asymmetry, Z and W pT
measurements) with leptonic decays. Focus on both the experimental
aspects (optimization of lepton scale up to 10^(-4) precision),
theoretical aspects (PDFs, QCD and EWK uncertainties) and measurement
aspects (global fitting procedure).

From 2016 I am also involved in the development of a gas TPC prototype
for WIMPs detection using a combined electronics and optical readout
of GEM technology (R&D of the detectors and data analysis of the
test-beams performed in 2016 and 2017 at the BTF in Frascati).
