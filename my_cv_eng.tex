{\bf{Research activity}}
\end{center}
My research activity focused on the experimental high energy physics.

From 2002 to 2007 it focused on the study of CP violation in the $B$
meson weak decays and the search of indirect signs of physics beyond
the Standard Model in the flavor sector through charmless $b \to s$
decays. Measurement of the time-dependent CP violation of the $B$
meson in three kaon decays, first in the quasi-two-body
approximation~\cite{Aubert:2005ja,conf_aps,conf_win05}, then including
interference effects through the Dalitz
plot~\cite{Aubert:2007sd,Aubert:2007mj,talk_nagoya,DiMarco:2006wg,talk_ichep}.
A new spin-zero resonance decaying in two charged kaons with mass
around 1.55 GeV/c$^2$, the $X_0(1550)$, have been found as
contributing to the Dalitz plot. Usage of ad hoc $B$ production vertex
measurement, based on $K^0_S$ vertex and $e^+e^-$ interaction point
constraint~\cite{Aubert:2005dy,Aubert:2007me}. These measurements
highly constrained the presence of non Standard Model processes with
large flavor violation.  I have been a collaborator of $BaBar$
experiment, running at the PEP-II $e^+e^-$ collider in the SLAC
laboratory (Stanford, California), from 2002 to
2009~\cite{seminario_ucsd,seminario_princeton,seminario_roma1_1,seminario_roma1_2}.

\vskip 0.5 truecm

From 2005 to 2006 operations manager and performance studies for the
muon and neutral hadron identification system of BaBar based on RPC
technology (IFR). Innovative algorithms for reconstructing and
identifying $K^0_L$ particles through the combined use of
electro-magnetic calorimeter (EMC) and IFR. Demonstration of the
aging effects of fluoridric acid (HF) production in the gas mixture
and possible mitigations of it~\cite{Band:2008zzb}. This detector has
shown a stable high efficiency through the entire data-taking period,
also with the change of the operating mode from {\it streamer} to {\it
  avalanche}~\cite{BandProc,Anulli:2005wi}. Upgrade of the barrel section of 
the IFR with Limited Streamer Tubes (LST).

\vskip 0.5 truecm

In 2005 and 2006 responsible for the $B$ flavour tagging efficiencies
and vertexing resolution, with the measurements used by all the BaBar
collaboration.  In 2005, tracking studies for the recovery of the loss
of efficiency in $K^0_S$ reconstruction after the shutdown, allowing a
complete recovery at the start of the new run period of BaBar.

\vskip 0.5 truecm

In 2007 I joined CMS collaboration and was involved on several
experimental activity regarding CMS commissioning: from 2007 to 2010
the high voltage system for the avalanche photo-diodes and development
of data quality monitoring of the electro-magnetic calorimeter
(ECAL)~\cite{ecal_craft}. On the software side, developer of the
online and offline ECAL Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) system, which is
still in use~\cite{proc_siena}.

From 2011 to 2014 responsible of the monitoring of
$PbWO_4$ crystals through a laser system, that is used to correct the
continuous transparency variations due to radiation during the LHC
fills.

\vskip 0.5 truecm

With the very early LHC data (36 pb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV),
principal author of the first measurement of the cross section for $W$
and $Z$ production in association to up 4
jets~\cite{cms_vecbos_paper,proc_ifae,conf_ifae09,conf_lishep}.  With
the same data, measurement of the $W$ charge asymmetry, useful as
constraints for the PDFs~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011jz}.  Contribution to
the first measurement of inclusive $W$ and $Z$ production with the
early data, with the electron
channels~\cite{inclusiveV_2010,Khachatryan:2010xn,conf_plhc,proc_plhc}.

\vskip 0.5 truecm 

From 2008 developer of electron reconstruction and identification with
the CMS early data. From 2013 to 2014 coordinator of the electrons
and photons reconstruction sub-group of the EGamma physics
group~\cite{elepaper}.

\vskip 0.5 truecm

Since 2007 involved in the direct search of the Higgs boson of the
Standard Model
(SM)~\cite{cms_hww_paper2010,Chatrchyan:2012ty,Chatrchyan:2012tx,conf_hh}.
From 2011 to 2012 in $CMS$ experiment analysis and convenorship of the
physics group for the search of the Higgs boson with $W$ pairs, that
gave the first indication of the 125 GeV particle, and finally
contributed to its discovery~\cite{higgsdiscovery}. Presented
personally at the ICHEP 2012 conference in
Melbourne~\cite{conf_ichep12,proc_ichep12}. Proposed an analysis
method to allow the mass measurement in the presence of two neutrinos
up to 3\% precision~\cite{Chatrchyan:2013iaa}.
Measurements of the SM $pp\to W^+W^-$
production cross section at $\sqrt{s}$=7 and 8 TeV.

From 2012 to 2014 one of the principal authors of the Higgs search
with ZZ$\to4\ell$ final state (on electrons optimization for the
search and then on the properties measurement: mass and
spin-CP~\cite{conf_ichep14}). Coordinator of the analysis group and
the editor of the paper~\cite{h4l_legacy} on Run I data from 2013 to
2014~\cite{h4l_jcp,h4l_differential}. Developer of an analysis technique
for unfolding effective Higgs couplings from data through an 8D fit,
in collaboration with theorists~\cite{h4l_8d}.

\vskip 0.5 truecm

From 2014 to 2017 convener of the CMS ECAL Detector Performace Group
(DPG) as a group convener, responsible for the optimizations of its
running conditions, energy reconstruction algorithms,
calibrations~\cite{photonpaper}. In this period I covered the
transition from Run I to Run II, when LHC changed the bunch spacing
from 50 to 25 ns.  In 2014, main developer of the of the completely
new local energy reconstruction algorithm for
ECAL~\cite{conf_ieee14}. This allowed ECAL to maintain the optimal
energy resolution in conditions of high pileup.  The algorithm is
still in use and performing well up to the unprecedented peak pileup
of 60 events per bunch crossing~\cite{conf_hc16}. It is the standard 
algoithm foreseen for the HL LHC phase in the ECAL barrel.

\vskip 0.5 truecm

From 2015 to 2017 participated to the search of dark matter with MET
plus jets in the final state with 2016 CMS data (``monojet'' and
invisible Higgs production), also with the supervision of a master
degree student (Rome ``La Sapienza'')~\cite{monojet}.

\vskip 0.5 truecm

From 2017, author of the preparatory measurements needed for the $W$
mass measurement ($W$ helicity, rapidity, charge asymmetry, $Z$ and
$W$ $p_T$ measurements) with leptonic decays. Focus on both the
experimental aspects (optimization of lepton scale up to $10^{-4}$
precision), theoretical aspects (PDFs, QCD and EWK uncertainties) and
measurement aspects (global fitting procedure).

\vskip 0.5 truecm

From 2016 I am also involved in the development of a gas TPC prototype
for WIMPs detection (R\&D of the detectors and data analysis of the
test-beams performed in 2016 and 2017 at the BTF in Frascati).
